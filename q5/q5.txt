If I were to create a software firm, I would most likely hire two of my friends, Anshika Maheshwari and Arkaprava Chakraborty, who have been a consistent source of support during any hackathon assignments or training classes. When launching a business, you need trust and coordination, which these folks have. So I would consider myself quite fortunate to have these two folks as partners in a new enterprise.
